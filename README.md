# Introduction about Iris Flower 

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Iris Flower Dataset, also called Fisherâ€™s Iris, is a dataset introduced by Ronald Fisher, a British statistician, and biologist, with several contributions to science. Ronald Fisher has well known worldwide for his paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis. It was in this paper that Ronald Fisher introduced the Iris flower dataset.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The iris database consists of 50 samples distributed among three different species of iris. Each of these samples has specific characteristics, which allows them to be classified into three categories: Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica, and Iris versicolor. In this tutorial, we will use multilayer perceptron to separate and classify the iris samples.</p>

- The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor).

- Four features were measured from each sample, the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

- Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.
